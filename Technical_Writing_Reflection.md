# Technical Writing Class Course Reflection:

Through hard work, determination, and great teaching, I have learned so much and have gained a great amount of skills from this Technical Writing class. I thought technical writing was only about converting complex technical information into simple layman terms for non-technologically inclined persons. I believe this course has overall made me an extremely better writer and conveyer of information, but this class has not only changed me as a writer. I believe it has changed me into a better professional individual.

A few examples of concepts I have learned through this class is how important planning is when drafting and finalizing both small and large technical documents. This class has also taught me the art of creating great memorandums, manuals, and proposals. Finally, one of the most important concepts I believe I have learned is how important it is to know who your target audience is. All of the examples I listed above will be very useful in the work place. For example, if I wanted to create a proposal to start a new project that will greatly impact the company; this class has taught me how to write a great and professional proposal.

 

# Projects:

The projects included in my portfolio are:

 - Pentesting Life Cycle Marketing Brochure
 - MultiFactor Authentication Through Yubikey Proposal
 - Ethically Sound Hackers within the Cybersecurity Realm
 - Successful Path to Graduation Manual
 - Yubikey Two-Factor Authentication: An Assessment of Usability, Acceptability, and Security
 - Cryptography Project
 - Cross Sums Puzzle Solver
 - Cellular Automate Simulator
 - The Equalizer
 
During my enrollment into the Technical Writing class, we were tasked with many different discussion posts, homework, manuals, and proposals. The following four projects, is what I consider to show the best of myself when it comes to technical writing, and how I have changed from the beginning to the end of the semester as a writer. The Pentesting Life Cycle Brochure taught me an important aspect on how to define a technical term to the context of a specific rhetorical situation. This was done in the format of a marketing brochure, aimed at making clients or potential clients aware of the different security risks they might encounter, and the steps to prevent or mitigate them.

The MultiFactor Authentication Through Yubikey Proposal was a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the National Institute for Research (NIR). This assignment taught me how to apply for grant money in the future, whether it was for research or at a company. The proposal I created was about MultiFactor Authentication using Yubikey and performing a study on the usability and acceptability of multifactor authentication.

The next assignment from my Technical Writing class I have decided to display in my portfolio is the very first discussion post we had for the class. We were tasked with researching the kinds of ethical decisions that workers in our chosen field may face. Then we had to write a one-page business letter to the class explaining what we had discovered. This leads me to create Ethically Sound Hackers within the Cybersecurity Realm. I wrote about the challenging decisions that cybersecurity engineers have to make regularly to make sure the work they perform is ethically sound. This assignment taught me two things, how to write a formal business letter, and how challenging the decisions cybersecurity engineers have to make.

The final assignment I have chosen to include in my portfolio is the Successful Path to Graduation Manual. The class was tasked with creating a 15-20 page manual for students new to RIT, telling them the things they must fo to complete their degrees. We had to take into account for both official requirements and intangible concerns. I also included some insider knowledge that I wished I knew when I first started ar RIT. It was my way of giving back and setting the new generation of RIT students on the right track. This assignment taught me how to create a professional manual while considering who my audience was going to be. This was our final assignment in the class besides the portfolio, but I believe it helped me the most out of all the other tasks we were assigned.

I believe all the projects I have included show my skills that I have learned during my time as an RIT student. All of these projects taught me many different things, from how to create an RFP to the security of second-factor authentication devices. I have a comprehensive spectrum of knowledge that I would love to share and teach to everyone I can. I hope these projects can teach you and show you the type of person I am.

# Career:

All of the skills I have learned and obtained during my time as an RIT student has made me a very intellectual person and a valuable job candidate. I not only know things about security, but I can also know how to program in many different languages (Python, Java, C, MIPS Assembly, HTML, CSS, Javascript, VB6, MS Visual Studio, and SQL). I can also create any technical documents needed, whether it is for a program, product, etc. This course fit within my career goals because it is not only teaching me how to become a better writer but also teaching me valuable lessons within the technical field. For example, creating a manual or marketing brochure for a company. One day I do want to start my own company, so these skills and lessons will be precious. I can connect this class to almost every single Computing Security class in my undergraduate program. Almost every lab I have performed for these classes needed a lab report. This class has taught me how to be a better technical writer, hence teaching me how to write my lab write-ups better. I can also connect this class to my internships at TAG Solutions (now Cyberstone) and Dell EMC. For both of these internships, I had to create reports for both my boss and the companies clients. Now looking back at the reports I created, I know what mistakes I made and how to improve the documents. This was a critical class for my career and has taught me many valuable skills and lessons.

# Portfolio:
From almost every website I visit, I am blinded by the bright white background. For my E-Portfolio, I have chosen to go with a darker background (like a dark mode), so the reader/audience will have a more enjoyable time reading about my projects and experiences. I also included easy-to-use navigation. The navigation selection is at the top of the screen and also follows you as you go down the screen. I also wanted the reader to know the different sections of the page. That's why I included different colored areas of the website. At the bottom of the screen is my contact information, with links to my LinkedIn, Github, Instagram, Twitter, and my RIT Email. I made sure to keep the website professional, but also show a little bit of my personal side. Throughout the Technical Writing class, one critical aspect we had to take into account was the audience of the report, manual, website, etc. This course helped me create my website by making me keep in mind of the audience. I made this website for any audience, whether it was my friends looking at it, or potential employers. I do want to say thank you to the professor of the class, Professor Markwardt, this class has taught me valuable skills and lessons, I will never forget this class. Thank you!
